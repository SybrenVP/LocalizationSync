2. This will open your web browser and ask you to **Make a Copy** of the template Google Sheet.
3. Click **Make a copy** to save it to your own Google Drive.

### Step 2: Deploy the Web App
*This step allows Godot to talk to your spreadsheet.*

2. A new tab will open showing the script editor. Click the blue **Deploy** button in the top right, then select **New deployment**.

5. Click **Deploy**.
6. Grant access/authorize the script if Google asks.

### Step 3: Connect to Godot
